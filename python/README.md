# Python Tutorial
Let's get to know Python. For these exercises we will follow the Python tutorial in W3 Schools. This will teach the basics of the python programing language. W3 has built in access to spaces that users can run basic python code. 

## The Python Language
Python is a popular, versatile, and beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It uses indentation to define code blocks, making it visually clean and easy to understand. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It comes with a large standard library and has a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for various applications such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive, allowing newcomers to quickly grasp programming concepts while also providing powerful tools for experienced developers to create complex applications efficiently.

## Exercises
Start by reading the [Introduction to Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp). Please don't commit it to memory but read it once to get an idea of how Python fits into the programming world.

### Syntax, Variables and Numbers

* [Numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp)

#### Assignment!
Create a python script that fits the requirements below. Use any of the try python editors in W3 Schools to develop and test your script. When it is finished open up a pull request and paste the output into the PR.
* Print a concatentation of 2+ strings
* Print the value of 2 ints added together
* Print the value of 2 floats subtracted
* Print the value of an int and float added together
